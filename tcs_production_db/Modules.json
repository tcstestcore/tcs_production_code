Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, body language, facial expressions, eye contact, and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to the intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating.[3] Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, the spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.", "ModuleCreatedBy" : "TCSAdmin001", "ModuleCreatedDate" : { "$date" : "2018-05-17T05:38:59.582+0000" }, "ModuleDiscountPrice" : "5", "ModuleDisplayDate" : { "$date" : "2018-05-17T05:38:59.582+0000" }, "ModuleMedia" : [ { "description" : "Big Buck Bunny tells the story of a giant rabbit with a heart bigger than himself.
